# Installing PHP Extenstions

RUN docker-php-ext-install mysqli pdo pdo_mysql 

# I had to run this before i could use the pecl
RUN apk add autoconf build-base

# This is needed for mongo use of ssl 
RUN apk add curl-dev openssl-dev

# This install mongodb since it is not available through docker-php-ext-install. When you install through pecl, you need to enable the extension, hence the second command
RUN pecl install mongodb && docker-php-ext-enable mongodb

# Redis installed through pecl and enabled
RUN pecl install redis && docker-php-ext-enable redis
